# Linux Icon Database

The **Linux Icon Database** is a comprehensive listing of icon identifiers used in Linux graphical environments. This repository serves as a reference point for developers, designers, and icon theme creators, helping to standardize and ensure compatibility of icons across Linux systems.

## Motivation

As mentioned earlier, the goal of this project is to serve as a reference point for locating existing icons across various themes. Due to the lack of documentation covering most of them or providing a comprehensive list, I decided to start this project to help people who want to explore a centralized place for system icons. In the end, I hope it proves useful to someone!

## About

Initially, this listing was generated by extracting icons from multiple themes installed by default on the system. The system I used for this was Linux Mint.

To ensure accuracy and avoid redundancies, the following steps were taken:

1. Almost all installed themes were merged into a single directory.
2. From there, icons with the same name but different formats (e.g., PNG/SVG) were filtered.
3. Only the icon identifiers were kept, creating a useful reference database.

I believe some icons might still be missing; however, these default system packages already cover most possible scenarios.

## Usage

The list can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Developing custom icon themes;
- Creating interfaces that follow Linux environment standards;
- Identifying the most common icons in Linux-based systems.

## Content

- [Icons](./ICONS.md): article containing general information about icons, including reference to identifier listings.
- [Creating a Custom Icon Pack for Linux](./CREATING-A-CUSTOM-ICON-PACK.md): A small utility guide that shows in a simple way how to create a custom icon pack.
