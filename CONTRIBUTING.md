# ðŸŒŸ Contributing to Linux Icon Database

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. The purpose of this article is to highlight and outline ways in which you can contribute to this project, as well as provide other useful information for the future.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide â€” in a complete and consistent manner â€” all the icons that may be used by Linux graphical environments. This listing compiles the most relevant and comprehensive content, with the goal of assisting those who are looking for which/how many icons exist or can be found.

An interesting observation is that, due to the great variety of icons, not all icon packs are homogeneous. In other words, some packs simply use icons that others do not have. This database includes icons used by various types of different packs, creating a kind of unique collection and standardizing the items.

## How to Contribute

Due to the nature of the project, you can contribute in several different ways. For example, you could help by adding more details to the existing information in the documents or by discovering new icons that are not yet listed. The possibilities are many.

If you wish to make modifications to the repository, feel free to fork it and then open a Pull Request with your proposed changes. Alternatively, you can create a simple issue to report any problems you have found.

### Submitting New Icons

If your contribution involves adding a new icon, it is important to not only add it to one of the tables found in the `Icons/` directory (following alphabetical order) but also attach the image of the icon for inclusion in the next release on the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Starciad/linux-icon-database/releases) page. The images are provided separately to avoid cluttering the repository and making it unnecessarily heavy. This repository should remain lightweight and primarily text-based.

## Conclusion

If you still have any questions, feel free to open an issue! In any case, I hope this document has been helpful.
